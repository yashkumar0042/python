## 1. Predicting Housing Prices

**Context:**  
When buying or selling a house, people often want to estimate the house’s market value. Common factors include the house’s square footage, the number of bedrooms, the age of the house, proximity to amenities, and so on.

**How Linear Regression is Used:**  
- **Goal:** Predict the price of a house given certain features (e.g., size, number of rooms).  
- **Process:** Collect historical data on houses and their selling prices along with their features. Fit a linear regression model with “price” as the target and features like size, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc., as independent variables.  
- **Interpretation:** After training, each coefficient (slope) in the model shows how much the price is expected to change with a one-unit change in that feature, while holding other features constant.

### Example in Python (Using Dummy Data)
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# 1. Create a dummy dataset
np.random.seed(42)  # for reproducible results
size = np.random.randint(800, 3000, 100)       # square footage
bedrooms = np.random.randint(1, 6, 100)        # number of bedrooms
prices = 100 * size + 20000 * bedrooms + np.random.randint(-5000, 5000, 100)

# 2. Build a DataFrame
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Size (sq ft)': size,
    'Bedrooms': bedrooms,
    'Price': prices
})

# 3. Separate features and target
X = data[['Size (sq ft)', 'Bedrooms']]
y = data['Price']

# 4. Fit the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# 5. Output the coefficients
print("Intercept:", model.intercept_)
print("Coefficients:", model.coef_)
```

- **Intercept** represents the base price when both features are zero (which usually doesn’t have a literal meaning for zero square footage—still, it’s part of the linear model).  
- **Coefficients** correspond to how the price changes with each unit increase in square footage or the number of bedrooms.

## 2. Predicting Sales Based on Advertising Spend

**Context:**  
A marketing team might want to know if there’s a relationship between how much they spend on advertising (TV, radio, online) and the resulting product sales.

**How Linear Regression is Used:**  
- **Goal:** Model or predict the sales (target) based on marketing spend across different channels (independent variables).  
- **Process:** Gather historical data on marketing spend (e.g., monthly budgets) for each channel (TV, digital, print) and the corresponding monthly sales. Fit a multiple linear regression to determine which channel most influences sales and to forecast future sales.  
- **Interpretation:** You can see, for example, that every additional \$1,000 spent on TV might yield 100 extra units sold, while every additional \$1,000 on digital ads might yield 200 extra units, etc.

### Example in Python (Using a Known Sample Dataset)
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Example data (abbreviated form)
# Suppose each row is: [TV Spend, Radio Spend, Social Media Spend, Sales]
sample_data = [
    [230, 37, 69, 22.1],
    [44, 39, 45, 10.4],
    [17, 45, 69, 9.3],
    [151, 41, 58, 18.5],
    [180, 10, 77, 12.9],
    # ...
]

df = pd.DataFrame(sample_data, columns=['TV', 'Radio', 'Social', 'Sales'])
X = df[['TV', 'Radio', 'Social']]
y = df['Sales']

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

print("Intercept:", model.intercept_)
print("Coefficients (TV, Radio, Social):", model.coef_)
```

- Each coefficient shows the effect of each advertising channel on sales, holding other channels constant.

## 3. Predicting Employee Salary Based on Experience

**Context:**  
Companies often use regression models to help with salary planning. An entry-level worker may earn less than a seasoned professional. The difference might be explained by factors such as years of experience, education level, and performance ratings.

**How Linear Regression is Used:**  
- **Goal:** Predict an employee’s salary (target) based on years of experience (and possibly other factors).  
- **Process:** Gather data on employees (years of experience, past salaries, performance scores, etc.). Fit a linear regression model to forecast salaries for new hires or see how salaries should progress with additional years of experience.  
- **Interpretation:** A slope of, say, 3,000 for “years of experience” would mean each additional year of experience is associated with \$3,000 higher annual salary, on average.

### Example in Python (Single Variable)
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Dummy dataset: years of experience vs. salary
experience = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]).reshape(-1, 1)
salary = np.array([35000, 38000, 42000, 45000, 49000, 52000, 55000, 60000, 65000, 70000])

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(experience, salary)

print("Intercept:", model.intercept_)
print("Coefficient for experience:", model.coef_[0])

# Predict salary for an employee with 7.5 years of experience
predicted_salary = model.predict([[7.5]])
print("Predicted salary for 7.5 years experience:", predicted_salary[0])
```

## 4. Forecasting Energy Consumption from Weather Conditions

**Context:**  
Power companies need to estimate how much electricity will be demanded to plan for capacity. Weather is a major factor: colder temperatures may increase heating demands, while hotter temperatures increase air conditioner usage.

**How Linear Regression is Used:**  
- **Goal:** Predict daily energy consumption (kWh) from factors like temperature, humidity, and day of the week.  
- **Process:** Collect historical data of daily energy consumption along with temperature and other weather data. Fit a model that estimates the usage based on these variables.  
- **Interpretation:** The model might show that a 1-degree drop in temperature in winter months adds a predictable number of kWh to daily usage.

### Simple Conceptual Example in Python
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Dummy data: daily average temp, humidity, and total energy consumption
np.random.seed(0)
temp = np.random.randint(0, 35, 50)  # degrees Celsius
humidity = np.random.randint(20, 80, 50)
energy = 200 + 3*temp + 2*humidity + np.random.normal(0, 10, 50)

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Temperature': temp,
    'Humidity': humidity,
    'Energy_Consumption': energy
})

X = df[['Temperature', 'Humidity']]
y = df['Energy_Consumption']

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

print("Intercept:", model.intercept_)
print("Coefficients [Temperature, Humidity]:", model.coef_)
```

## 5. Determining the Effect of Pricing on Product Demand

**Context:**  
Retailers and manufacturers want to understand how changing the price of a product may affect the quantity demanded.

**How Linear Regression is Used:**  
- **Goal:** Estimate demand (quantity sold) based on the price.  
- **Process:** Gather historical data of different prices for the product and how many units were sold at those prices. Fit a model that finds a linear relationship between price and demand (though often, more advanced or non-linear methods could be used).  
- **Interpretation:** If the coefficient is negative, it confirms that demand typically goes down as price goes up.

### Simple Example in Python (Single Variable)
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

price = np.array([5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]).reshape(-1, 1)  # product price in $
demand = np.array([100, 90, 75, 65, 50, 40])  # units sold

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(price, demand)

print("Intercept:", model.intercept_)
print("Coefficient for price:", model.coef_[0])

# Predict demand if product is sold at $7.5
predicted_demand = model.predict([[7.5]])
print("Predicted demand at $7.5:", predicted_demand[0])
```

## Key Points About Linear Regression

1. **Linearity Assumption:**  
   Linear Regression assumes the relationship between the independent variables and the target is (at least approximately) linear.

2. **Interpretability:**  
   The coefficients in a linear model tell you how much the target changes for a one-unit change in the corresponding feature, making it relatively straightforward to interpret.

3. **Multiple vs. Simple Linear Regression:**  
   - **Simple Linear Regression:** One predictor (independent variable) and one outcome (dependent variable).  
   - **Multiple Linear Regression:** Multiple predictors.

4. **Assumptions to Check:**  
   - **No or little multicollinearity** among independent variables.  
   - **Homoscedasticity** (constant variance of errors).  
   - **Normality of residuals** (often assumed, but real-world data may violate this).  
   - **Independence of residuals** (important for time-series or sequential data).

5. **Practical Tips:**  
   - Always visualize your data (scatterplots, residual plots) to see if a linear fit makes sense.  
   - Scale your data if features have very different ranges or units.  
   - Consider using regularization techniques (Ridge, Lasso) if you have many correlated features or want to reduce overfitting.
