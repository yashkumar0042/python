# 1. Terminology and Setup

- **Regression** models predict a **continuous** value (e.g., house price, sales amount, temperature).  
- **Classification** models predict a **categorical** label (e.g., spam vs. not spam, disease vs. no disease).

We’ll use two built-in datasets from scikit-learn for illustration:

- **Synthetic Regression Data**: using `make_regression()` for regression examples (Linear Regression).  
- **Iris Dataset**: using `load_iris()` for classification examples (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Gradient Boosting).

> **Note:** The code blocks contain line-by-line comments so you understand each step.

# 2. Linear Regression (Regression)

**Purpose:** Predict a continuous value (e.g., price, salary).  
**Key Points:**
- Finds a linear relationship between features \(X\) and target \(y\).  
- **Interpretability:** High (coefficients directly show how each feature influences the target).  
- **Complexity:** Low (simple to implement, fast to train).  

```python
# ========================
#       LINEAR REGRESSION
# ========================

from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# 1. Generate synthetic regression data
#    n_samples=1000 -> number of data points
#    n_features=5   -> number of predictive features
#    noise=10       -> adds some random variation
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=1000, n_features=5, noise=10, random_state=42)

# 2. Split into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# 3. Initialize the Linear Regression model
model_lr = LinearRegression()

# 4. Fit (train) the model on the training data
model_lr.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 5. Predict on the test set
y_pred_lr = model_lr.predict(X_test)

# 6. Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE)
mse_lr = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_lr)
print("Linear Regression MSE:", mse_lr)

# 7. Inspect model coefficients and intercept
print("Coefficients:", model_lr.coef_)
print("Intercept:", model_lr.intercept_)
```

- **When to use:** When you suspect a relatively **linear** relationship between variables and need a fast, simple, interpretable model.

---

# 3. Logistic Regression (Classification)

**Purpose:** Predict a **binary** or **multi-class** label (e.g., whether an email is spam, or one of several possible classes).  
**Key Points:**
- Despite the name “regression,” it’s used **for classification** (especially binary).  
- Uses a logistic (sigmoid) or softmax function for multi-class.  
- **Interpretability:** Coefficients can tell you the effect of each feature on the log-odds of the outcome.  

```python
# =========================
#     LOGISTIC REGRESSION
# =========================

from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# 1. Load the Iris dataset (classification problem)
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target  # features, labels (3 species of Iris)

# 2. Split into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# 3. Initialize the Logistic Regression model
#    multi_class='auto' works well for multi-class data
model_logreg = LogisticRegression(multi_class='auto', max_iter=1000)  
# max_iter=1000 to ensure convergence

# 4. Fit (train) the model
model_logreg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 5. Predict on the test set
y_pred_logreg = model_logreg.predict(X_test)

# 6. Evaluate using accuracy
accuracy_logreg = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_logreg)
print("Logistic Regression Accuracy:", accuracy_logreg)

# 7. Inspect model coefficients
print("Coefficients:", model_logreg.coef_)
print("Intercepts:", model_logreg.intercept_)
```

- **When to use:** Fast baseline classification model; good if you want to interpret feature importance easily.

---

# 4. Decision Tree (Classification or Regression)

**Purpose:** Works for both classification and regression.  
**Key Points:**
- Uses a tree structure: splits data into smaller subsets based on feature thresholds.  
- **Interpretability:** A single tree can be visually inspected (though can become complex with many splits).  
- **Complexity:** Can overfit if not pruned or regularized.  

```python
# ==================
#   DECISION TREE
# ==================

from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# 1. Load the Iris data again
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# 2. Split into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# 3. Initialize a Decision Tree classifier
#    max_depth=3 -> limit tree depth to avoid overfitting
model_dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3, random_state=42)

# 4. Train the model
model_dt.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 5. Predict on test set
y_pred_dt = model_dt.predict(X_test)

# 6. Calculate accuracy
accuracy_dt = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_dt)
print("Decision Tree Accuracy:", accuracy_dt)
```

- **When to use:** If you need an **easy-to-interpret** model (especially if you visualize it) and can handle non-linear relationships.

---

# 5. Random Forest (Classification or Regression)

**Purpose:** An **ensemble** of Decision Trees that improves accuracy and stability.  
**Key Points:**
- Uses **bagging** (bootstrap aggregation) to train multiple trees on random subsets of the data & features.  
- **Interpretability:** Harder than a single tree, but you can still get feature importances.  
- **Complexity:** More robust and less prone to overfitting compared to a single Decision Tree.  

```python
# ==================
#   RANDOM FOREST
# ==================

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# 1. Load Iris data
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# 2. Split dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# 3. Initialize a Random Forest
#    n_estimators=100 means we use 100 trees in the ensemble
model_rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# 4. Fit the model
model_rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 5. Predict
y_pred_rf = model_rf.predict(X_test)

# 6. Evaluate
accuracy_rf = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_rf)
print("Random Forest Accuracy:", accuracy_rf)

# 7. (Optional) Feature importances
print("Feature importances:", model_rf.feature_importances_)
```

- **When to use:** Whenever you want a **powerful, general-purpose** model that usually performs well out of the box, at the cost of some interpretability.

---

# 6. Support Vector Machine (Classification or Regression)

**Purpose:** Works for both tasks; often used for classification (SVC).  
**Key Points:**
- Tries to find the **optimal hyperplane** that maximizes margin between classes.  
- Can use **kernel tricks** to handle non-linear data (e.g., RBF kernel).  
- **Complexity:** Typically memory-intensive for large datasets; can be powerful if tuned well.  

```python
# ==================
# SVM (CLASSIFIER)
# ==================

from sklearn.svm import SVC

# 1. Load Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# 2. Split dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# 3. Initialize SVM with RBF kernel
model_svc = SVC(kernel='rbf', C=1.0, gamma='scale', random_state=42)

# 4. Train the model
model_svc.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 5. Predict on the test set
y_pred_svc = model_svc.predict(X_test)

# 6. Evaluate
accuracy_svc = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_svc)
print("SVM Accuracy:", accuracy_svc)
```

- **When to use:** If you have **moderate-sized** data with complex boundaries; SVMs often perform well with good parameter tuning.

---

# 7. K-Nearest Neighbors (Classification or Regression)

**Purpose:** Classify a sample by looking at the “k-nearest” training samples.  
**Key Points:**
- **Instance-based** learning: no explicit training model, it memorizes the data.  
- **Interpretability:** Easy concept (vote among neighbors), but harder to see global feature effects.  
- **Complexity:** Prediction can be slow for large datasets, because you must search for nearest neighbors at inference.  

```python
# =========================
# K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS (KNN)
# =========================

from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# 1. Load the Iris data
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# 2. Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# 3. Initialize KNN
#    n_neighbors=3 -> look at 3 nearest neighbors
model_knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)

# 4. Train (actually just stores the training data)
model_knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 5. Predict
y_pred_knn = model_knn.predict(X_test)

# 6. Evaluate
accuracy_knn = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_knn)
print("KNN Accuracy:", accuracy_knn)
```

- **When to use:** Good for smaller datasets or when the decision boundary is highly irregular. Less efficient for very large data.

---

# 8. Gradient Boosting (Classification or Regression)

**Purpose:** Another **ensemble** method that builds trees sequentially, each new tree correcting errors of the previous ensemble.  
**Key Points:**
- Often **highly accurate** with proper hyperparameter tuning.  
- **Interpretability:** Harder than a single tree, but you can get feature importances.  
- **Complexity:** Typically slower to train than Random Forest but can yield better performance.  

```python
# ========================
#   GRADIENT BOOSTING
# ========================

from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier

# 1. Load Iris data
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# 2. Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# 3. Initialize Gradient Boosting
model_gb = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, random_state=42)

# 4. Train the model
model_gb.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 5. Predict on test data
y_pred_gb = model_gb.predict(X_test)

# 6. Evaluate
accuracy_gb = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_gb)
print("Gradient Boosting Accuracy:", accuracy_gb)

# 7. Feature importances
print("Feature importances:", model_gb.feature_importances_)
```

- **When to use:** If you need a top-performing model and can afford extra time to tune hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of estimators, max_depth).

---

# 9. Differences Among These Models

# 10. Model Selection Criteria

When deciding **which model** to use, consider:

1. **Data Size**:  
   - Large data? Random Forest or Gradient Boosting can handle it, but watch training time.  
   - Smaller data? SVM or KNN can sometimes shine.

2. **Interpretability**:  
   - Need transparency? Linear/Logistic Regression or a small Decision Tree.  
   - OK with black box? Random Forest or Gradient Boosting often have better accuracy.

3. **Training Speed vs. Prediction Speed**:  
   - KNN is fast to train (stores data) but slower to predict.  
   - Linear/Logistic Regression are fast in both training and prediction.  
   - Tree-based ensembles can be slower to train but fast at prediction.

4. **Data Complexity (Linearity vs. Non-Linearity)**:  
   - Linear/Logistic Regression assume linear relationships.  
   - Tree-based models and SVM (with kernels) can capture non-linearities more easily.

---

## Conclusion

- **Linear models** (Linear/Logistic Regression) are great for interpretability and speed.  
- **Tree-based models** (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) are powerful for capturing complex patterns and often deliver higher accuracy at the cost of interpretability.  
- **Instance-based methods** (KNN) are simple but can be computationally expensive at prediction time.  
- **SVM** can handle complex boundaries well, but requires tuning and doesn’t scale easily to very large datasets.

By understanding the **strengths, weaknesses,** and **intended use cases** of each model, you can select the most appropriate approach for your real-world machine learning tasks.
