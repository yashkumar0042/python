You can view the list of Git configurations by using the `git config` command with the `--list` option. This option displays all configuration settings in your Git environment. Here's how you can do it:

### To See Git Config List:

```bash
git config --list
```

This command will output a list of all the configuration settings in your Git environment. The output will include configuration settings from three levels: system, global, and local (repository-specific).

If you want to filter the results by a specific level, you can use the `--system`, `--global`, or `--local` options:

```bash
# Show system-level configuration
git config --system --list

# Show global-level configuration
git config --global --list

# Show local (repository-specific) configuration
git config --local --list
```

### Example Output:

Here's an example of what the output might look like:

```bash
user.name=Your Name
user.email=your.email@example.com
core.repositoryformatversion=0
core.filemode=true
core.bare=false
core.logallrefupdates=true
```

This output shows some of the basic configurations, such as the user name and email associated with commits, as well as core Git settings.

Note: The configurations displayed can vary based on your Git setup and the repositories you are working with. The `--list` option provides a comprehensive view of all configurations.

If you are looking for a specific configuration setting, you can use the following command:

```bash
git config <config_key>
```

Replace `<config_key>` with the specific configuration key you are interested in. For example:

```bash
git config user.name
```

This command will display the user name configured in Git.
