In Git, a `commit` and a `squash commit` refer to different ways of managing changes in a version control system. Let's explore the differences between the two:

1. **Commit:**
   - A regular commit in Git represents a single, atomic unit of change.
   - Each commit captures a snapshot of the entire working directory at a specific point in time.
   - Commits are fundamental to Git's version control system and provide a detailed history of changes over time.
   - Commits help in maintaining a clear and granular history, making it easier to track down issues, understand the evolution of the codebase, and collaborate with others.

2. **Squash Commit:**
   - Squashing commits is a process of combining multiple commits into a single commit.
   - Typically done during interactive rebasing or merging to condense several commits into a more cohesive and comprehensible form.
   - Squashing is useful to simplify the commit history, especially when working on feature branches, so that the main branch has a cleaner, more linear history.
   - It helps in avoiding too many small, incremental commits that might not be relevant for the overall history of the project.

**Example:**
Suppose you have a feature branch with multiple commits, and you want to squash the last three commits into a single commit before merging into the main branch:

```bash
# Start interactive rebase
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# In the interactive rebase, change "pick" to "squash" or "s" for the commits you want to squash

# Edit the commit message if needed and save

# Complete the rebase
```

After this process, the last three commits will be combined into a single commit with a new commit message.

**Use Cases:**
- **Commits:**
  - Suitable for making granular changes, tracking the evolution of a feature, and maintaining a detailed history.
  - Useful when each commit represents a distinct, logical step in the development process.

- **Squash Commits:**
  - Useful for cleaning up the commit history before merging feature branches into the main branch.
  - Helps in presenting a more organized and concise history, making it easier for others to review and understand the changes.

Both commits and squash commits have their place in Git workflows, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the project and the team's preferences for managing the commit history.
