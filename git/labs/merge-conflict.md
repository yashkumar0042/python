Merge conflicts can occur when two branches have changes in the same part of a file, and Git is unable to automatically merge them. Resolving merge conflicts involves manually combining the changes and then committing the result. Let's walk through a simple lab to simulate a merge conflict and resolve it.

### Lab: Merge Conflict Resolution

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```

#### Step 2: Create a New Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/branch1
```

#### Step 3: Make Changes to a File
Edit a file, for example, `example.txt`, and add the following content:
```
This is some content in branch1.
```

#### Step 4: Commit Changes
```bash
git add example.txt
git commit -m "Committing changes in branch1"
```

#### Step 5: Switch to Main Branch
```bash
git checkout main
```

#### Step 6: Create Another Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/branch2
```

#### Step 7: Make Conflicting Changes to the Same File
Edit the same file `example.txt` and add the following content:
```
This is some content in branch2.
```

#### Step 8: Commit Changes
```bash
git add example.txt
git commit -m "Committing conflicting changes in branch2"
```

#### Step 9: Attempt to Merge
```bash
git merge feature/branch1
```

You'll likely encounter a merge conflict at this point.

#### Step 10: Resolve the Conflict
Manually resolve the conflict in `example.txt`. Open the file, look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`), and edit the content to combine the changes as needed.

#### Step 11: Add and Commit the Resolved Changes
```bash
git add example.txt
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in branch2"
```

#### Step 12: Complete the Merge
```bash
git merge --continue
```

#### Step 13: Clean Up (Optional)
```bash
git branch -d feature/branch1
git branch -d feature/branch2
```



Remember to replace `<repository_url>` and `<repository_directory>` with your actual repository URL and directory. Adapt branch names and file names based on your project structure.
