### 1. Git Fetch:

- **Purpose:**
  - Fetching is used to retrieve changes from a remote repository without automatically merging them into your local branch.

- **Workflow:**
  - When you run `git fetch`, Git contacts the remote repository and fetches any new changes, including branches and tags.
  - It updates the remote-tracking branches in your local repository to reflect the changes in the remote repository.

- **Example:**
  ```bash
  # Fetch changes from the remote repository (origin)
  git fetch origin
  ```

- **Use Case:**
  - Useful when you want to see what changes exist in the remote repository before deciding to merge them into your local branch.
  - Allows you to review changes and decide when and how to integrate them.

### 2. Git Pull:

- **Purpose:**
  - Pulling is a combination of fetching changes and automatically merging them into your current branch.

- **Workflow:**
  - When you run `git pull`, it performs a `git fetch` first to retrieve the changes from the remote repository.
  - Then, it automatically merges the changes into your local branch.

- **Example:**
  ```bash
  # Pull changes from the remote repository (origin) into the current branch
  git pull origin master
  ```

- **Use Case:**
  - Convenient when you want to quickly update your local branch with the latest changes from the remote repository.
  - Automatically merges changes, saving you an additional step compared to `git fetch`.

### Summary:

- If you want to fetch changes and review them before merging:
  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  ```

- If you want to fetch changes and automatically merge them into your current branch:
  ```bash
  git pull origin master
  ```

Choose the command based on your workflow preference â€“ whether you prefer more control and visibility (`git fetch`) or a quick update with automatic merging (`git pull`).
