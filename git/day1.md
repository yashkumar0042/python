# 1. Getting Started

## Introduction
- Version control is essential for collaborative software development.
- Git is a distributed version control system widely used for tracking changes in source code.

## Why Version Control?
- Collaborative work: Enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously.
- History tracking: Keeps a record of changes made to the codebase.
- Branching and merging: Facilitates parallel development and code integration.

# 2. About Version Control

## Types of Version Control Systems
- Centralized VCS: Single repository, requires constant network connection.
- Distributed VCS: Multiple local repositories, independent of network.

## Git as a Distributed VCS
- Each user has a complete copy of the repository.
- Changes are tracked independently, allowing offline work.

# 3. A Short History of Git

## Inception
- Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.
- Developed for managing the Linux kernel source code.

## Key Milestones
- Git becomes widely adopted in open-source projects.
- GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket provide hosting and collaboration.

# 4. What is Git?

## Definition
- Git is a distributed version control system.
- Manages and tracks changes in source code during software development.

## Core Concepts
- Repository: Storage for project files and version history.
- Commit: Snapshot of changes at a specific point in time.
- Branch: Independent line of development.

# 5. The Command Line

## Basic Commands
- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository.
- `git add`: Adds changes to the staging area.
- `git commit`: Records changes to the repository.

- Customize Git settings for user preferences.

# 8. Getting Help

## Documentation
- Official Git documentation available online.
- Use `git --help` for command-specific help.
- Community forums and Q&A sites for additional support.

# 9. Summary

## Key Takeaways
- Git is a distributed version control system.

# 2. Getting a Git Repository

## Initializing a Repository
- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
- Creates a hidden `.git` directory to store configuration and version history.

## Cloning a Repository
- `git clone <repository URL>`: Downloads an existing Git repository to your local machine.
- Establishes a connection with the remote repository.

# 2. Recording Changes to the Repository

## Tracking Changes
- `git status`: Shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.
- `git add <file>`: Adds changes to the staging area.

## Committing Changes
- `git commit -m "Commit message"`: Records changes in the repository.
- Commits create a snapshot in the version history.

# 3. Viewing the Commit History

## Git Log
- `git log`: Displays a chronological list of commits.
- Shows commit hash, author, date, and commit message.

## Customizing Log Output
- `git log --oneline`: Condenses commit information to one line.
- `git log --graph`: Visualizes branch history.

# 4. Undoing Things

## Discarding Changes
- `git restore <file>`: Discards changes in a file.
- `git restore --source=<commit> <file>`: Restores a file to a specific commit.

## Amending Commits
- `git commit --amend`: Adds changes to the previous commit.
- Useful for fixing mistakes in the last commit.

# 5. Working with Remotes

## Adding Remotes
- `git remote add <name> <url>`: Links a local repository to a remote repository.
- Common remotes include GitHub or GitLab.

## Fetching and Pulling
- `git fetch`: Retrieves changes from the remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetches changes and integrates them into the current branch.

# 6. Tagging

## Creating Tags
- `git tag <tagname>`: Marks a specific commit with a tag.
- Useful for releasing versions or marking significant points.

## Pushing Tags
- `git push origin <tagname>`: Shares tags with the remote repository.

# 7. Git Aliases

## Creating Aliases
- `git config --global alias.<alias-name> <git-command>`: Sets up custom shorthand for Git commands.
- Improves efficiency and reduces typing.

# 8. Summary

## Key Takeaways
- Git repositories are initialized with `git init` or cloned with `git clone`.
- Changes are recorded with `git add` and `git commit`.
- View commit history with `git log` and customize output.
- Undo changes with `git restore` and amend commits.
- Remotes are managed using `git remote`.
- Tags mark important points in history.
- Git aliases streamline common commands.

Certainly! Here are detailed PowerPoint notes on the Git Branching topics:

---

# 3. Branches in a Nutshell

## Introduction
- Branching is a fundamental concept in Git.
- Allows for parallel development and isolation of features.

## Main Branches
- `master` (or `main`): Default branch, represents the main line of development.
- `develop`: Common for ongoing development work.

## Feature Branches
- Created for developing specific features or bug fixes.
- Isolates changes until ready for integration.

# 2. Basic Branching and Merging

## Creating a Branch
- `git branch <branch-name>`: Creates a new branch.
- `git checkout <branch-name>` or `git switch <branch-name>`: Switches to the new branch.

## Basic Merging
- `git merge <branch-name>`: Integrates changes from one branch into another.
- Merges can result in a merge commit.

# 3. Branch Management

## Viewing Branches
- `git branch`: Lists all local branches.
- `git branch -d <branch-name>`: Deletes a branch after merging.

## Switching Branches
- `git checkout <branch-name>` or `git switch <branch-name>`: Moves to a different branch.
- `git checkout -b <new-branch>` or `git switch -c <new-branch>`: Creates and switches to a new branch.

# 4. Branching Workflows

## Feature Branch Workflow
- Create a branch for each feature.
- Merge back into `develop` or `main` when ready.

## Gitflow Workflow
- Uses `master`, `develop`, feature branches, release branches, and hotfix branches.
- Provides a structured approach to software development.

# 5. Remote Branches

## Tracking Remote Branches
- `git fetch origin`: Retrieves information about remote branches.
- `git branch -r`: Lists remote branches.
- `git checkout -b <local-branch> origin/<remote-branch>`: Creates a local branch tracking a remote branch.

# 6. Rebasing

## Rebasing vs. Merging
- `git rebase <branch-name>`: Incorporates changes from one branch into another by moving or combining commits.
- Results in a linear commit history.

## Interactive Rebasing
- `git rebase -i <commit>`: Allows for interactive rebasing, such as squashing commits.

# 7. Summary

## Key Takeaways
- Branches provide isolation for development work.
- Basic branching involves creating, switching, and merging branches.
- Branch management includes viewing, deleting, and switching branches.
- Different branching workflows suit various development scenarios.
- Remote branches allow collaboration with others.
- Rebasing can be an alternative to merging, providing a linear history.
