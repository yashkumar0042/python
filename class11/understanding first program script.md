Sure! Let's break down the structure and purpose of a simple Python script, often referred to as a "hello world" program, which prints the phrase "Hello, world!" to the screen. Here's an explanation of each part:

```python
# This is a comment in Python. Comments start with the '#' symbol and are ignored by the Python interpreter.
# Comments are used to add explanations or notes to the code.

print("Hello, world!")
# The print() function in Python is used to output text (or other data) to the console (terminal).
# Here, we are passing the string "Hello, world!" to the print() function as an argument.
# The string is enclosed in double quotes, indicating that it is a sequence of characters.
# When the print() function is executed, it displays the text "Hello, world!" on the screen.
```

Now, let's go through the steps of understanding and running this script:

1. **Comment**: The first line of the script starts with `#`, indicating that it's a comment. Comments are not executed by Python; they are there for human readers to understand the code. In this case, the comment provides a brief description of what the script does.

2. **Print Statement**: The next line contains the `print()` statement, which is a built-in function in Python. This function is used to display output to the console. In this case, it displays the string `"Hello, world!"`. Strings in Python are enclosed in either single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.

3. **Execution**: To run this script, you save the code in a file with a `.py` extension, such as `hello.py`. Then, you execute the script using the Python interpreter. In a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the script and run:

    ```
    python hello.py
    ```

    The output will be:

    ```
    Hello, world!
    ```

    This output indicates that the script ran successfully, and the text `"Hello, world!"` was printed to the console.

This simple script serves as an introductory example to Python programming. It demonstrates how to use the `print()` function to output text and introduces the concept of comments for adding explanations to the code.
